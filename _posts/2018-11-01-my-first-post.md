Welcome to my brand new blog!

## What this blog is for

This is a very simple demo site for learning about static site generators, using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) as an example.

I'll add some [cupcake ipsum](http://www.cupcakeipsum.com/) to fill more of the page between headings. 

Cupcake ipsum dolor sit. Amet liquorice jelly sweet oat cake biscuit. Jujubes toffee liquorice wafer bear claw halvah apple pie cake bear claw.

Candy oat cake muffin cake bonbon marzipan. Lollipop cookie caramels cake muffin jujubes chocolate cake danish liquorice. Chupa chups topping pastry candy toffee biscuit apple pie.

## Just for fun
