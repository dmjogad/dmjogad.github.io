# jekyll-sustained

A simple starter repository built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static site generator, adapted from the [Sustain](http://www.github.com/jekyller/sustain) theme.

## Demo

* [https://jekyll-sustained.netlify.com/](https://jekyll-sustained.netlify.com/)

## Instant Deploy

To begin experimenting with it, use the button below to copy the repository to your GitHub account and deploy it to Netlify:

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/verythorough/jekyll-sustained)

### Wait, what happens when I click that button?

Good question. Here's what it will do...

1. Netlify will clone the Git repository of this project into your Github or GitLab account. It will be asking for permission to add the repo for you.
2. We'll create a new site for you in Netlify, and configure it to use your shiny new repo. Right away you'll be able to deploy changes by pushing changes to your repo.
3. That's it really.

## Make changes in the GitHub UI

Try:

- editing values in `_config.yml`
- creating a new blog post like the others in `_posts/`
- changing or adding projects in `_data/projects.json`
- customizing the visual style in `static/css/main.css`

## Run Locally
